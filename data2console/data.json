The hardening process has involved elimination of the natural riparian habitat and replacement of the natural stream channel with a concrete-lined conduit having vertical walls and a broad, flat bottom. The shallow depth of the water column and the absence of shade have resulted in temperatures that average as much as 4-5oC above ambient and rise as high as 32oC during daylight hours. Unlike most low-order streams, the hardened sections of both streams are autotrophic, as evidenced by elevated pH values and O2 concentrations as high as 150% of saturation. Several allochthonous inputs, one from a storm sewer and the other from a natural spring, introduced water with anomalously low O2 concentrations and very high nitrate concentrations. The absence of sediments in the hardened sections of the streams precludes natural sedimentary microbial processes, including denitrification. Nitrate concentrations in a section of Waimanalo Stream with a natural streambed drop dramatically from values in excess of 400 ?M to concentrations less than 10 ?M at the head of the estuary. Although some of this decline is due to dilution with seawater, the concentration of nitrate at the head of the estuary is only 10% of the value that could be explained by dilution effects. Biological processes associated with a natural streambed thus appear very important to the functionality of the streams and in particular to their ability to process allochthonous nutrient inputs in a way that minimizes impacts on the nearshore environment. Prevention of flooding can be accomplished by mechanisms that do not involve elimination of riparian buffer zones and destruction of channel habitat. To maintain water quality and stream functionality, it will be important that these alternative methods of flood control be utilized. Converting natural streams to storm sewers is an unenlightened way to address flooding problems.","spatialBounding":{"coordinates":[[-157.8,21.41],[-157.71,21.36]],"type":"envelope"},"alternateTitle":null,"title":"Continuous water quality monitoring to determine the cause of coral reef ecosystem degradation for coastal windward Oahu streams during 2002 (NODC Accession 0001070)","dsmmDataQualityAssessment":0,"gcmdDataResolution":[],"acquisitionInstruments":[],"gcmdInstruments":["THERMOMETERS"],"links":[{"linkFunction":"information","linkDescription":"Navigate directly to the URL for a descriptive web page with download links.","linkUrl":"https://accession.nodc.noaa.gov/0001070","linkName":"Descriptive Information","linkProtocol":"HTTPS"},{"linkFunction":"information","linkDescription":"Navigate directly to the URL for a descriptive web page with download links.","linkUrl":"https://accession.nodc.noaa.gov/oas/1070","linkName":"Descriptive Information","linkProtocol":"HTTPS"},{"linkFunction":"download","linkDescription":"Navigate directly to the URL for data access and direct download.","linkUrl":"https://accession.nodc.noaa.gov/download/1070","linkName":"HTTPS","linkProtocol":"HTTPS"},{"linkFunction":"download","linkDescription":"These data are available through the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).

Minerals Management Service (MMS) initiated these studies to characterize the pre and post construction environmental impacts surrounding the offshore oil development and production activities in this area. The data encompasses the following areas from 1999 thru 2007:1) Hydrocarbon and Metal characterization of sediments.Sediments were collected and analyzed for a variety of parameters including Organics (PAH, SHC, and S/T), Grain size, TOC, trace metals and radionuclides (Pb210 and Cs137).2) Sources, Concentrations and dispersion pathways for suspended sediment and 3) Partitioning of potential contaminants between dissolved and particulate phases.These two tasks focused on suspended sediments and the dissolved / particulates in the water column in fresh and salt water and ice cores. The study analyzed for both chemical and physical parameters that included insitu CTD measurements, POC, DOC, trace and major metals.4) Biomonitoring and bioaccumulation of contaminants in biota.The biota studied included amphipods, isopods, clams, fish, mussels and SPMD. These tissues were analyzed for metals, PAH, PAH exposure biomarkers (cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1a) and bile fluorescent aromatic compounds (FAC)).5) Monitoring the Boulder patch area.This area of the program studied the benthic community and kelp biomass. Parameters of interest included: PAR, light attenuation, TSS, kelp productivity and biomass and benthic faunal diversity.

This tool complements ongoing geochemical surveys and monitoring efforts in the region by providing estimates of changing ocean chemistry on a broader spatial and temporal scale than shipboard observations alone can permit. The maps presented here are monthly averages of daily estimates derived according to Gledhill et al., 2008. Near-real-time estimates are modeled from daily fields of NOAA Optimum Interpolation Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer - Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AVHRR-AMSRE) SST, Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model + Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation (HYCOM + NCODA) modeled sea surface salinity (SSS), NOAA National Centers for Environmental Predication (NCEP) sea-level pressure (SLP), and estimates of atmospheric CO2 derived from the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory GLOBALVIEW-CO2 reference marine boundary layer (MBL). The parameters provided in this data set include sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), partial pressure of carbon dioxide for seawater (pCO2sw), total alkilinity (TA), total inorganic carbon (TC), pH, aragonite saturation state (SSA), bicarbonate ion concentration (HCO3), and carbonate ion concentration (CO3).

This tool complements ongoing geochemical surveys and monitoring efforts in the region by providing estimates of changing ocean chemistry on a broader spatial and temporal scale than shipboard observations alone can permit. The maps presented here are monthly averages of daily estimates derived according to Gledhill et al., 2008. Near-real-time estimates are modeled from daily fields of NOAA Optimum Interpolation Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer - Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AVHRR-AMSRE) SST, Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model + Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation (HYCOM + NCODA) modeled sea surface salinity (SSS), NOAA National Centers for Environmental Predication (NCEP) sea-level pressure (SLP), and estimates of atmospheric CO2 derived from the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory GLOBALVIEW-CO2 reference marine boundary layer (MBL). The parameters provided in this data set include sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), partial pressure of carbon dioxide for seawater (pCO2sw), total alkilinity (TA), total inorganic carbon (TC), pH, aragonite saturation state (SSA), bicarbonate ion concentration (HCO3), and carbonate ion concentration (CO3).

Various other stations are made intermittently in support of similar research objectives or mooring deployments.Samples of water column chemical analyses were collected mostly in the upper 1000m using Niskin bottles mounted on a rosette. The strategy was to sample at density horizons within the main thermocline at pressure horizons above and below this region (i.e., <150 dbar and >2000 dbar).

The probe was secured to the shoreline of Tatoosh Island, and was housed in a 5000 l tidepool separated from the ocean by a 1 wide lip at a tide height of 80 cm to assure that probe performance was not compromised by desiccation at low tide. These data form the core of analyses in Pfister et al. (L&O 2007), Wootton et al. (PNAS 2008), and Wootton and Pfister (PLoS ONE In Press 2012).","spatialBounding":{"coordinates":[[-124.7343,48.3931],[-124.7343,48.3931]],"type":"envelope"},"alternateTitle":null,"title":"Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Temperature, Salinity, and others collected via time series logging probe at Tatoosh Island, Washington from June 4, 2000 to August 23, 2010 (NODC Accession 0099812)","dsmmDataQualityAssessment":0,"gcmdDataResolution":[],"acquisitionInstruments":[],"gcmdInstruments":["CONDUCTIVITY METERS","OXYGEN METERS","TEMPERATURE SENSORS"],"links":[{"linkFunction":"information","linkDescription":"Navigate directly to the URL for a descriptive web page with download links.","linkUrl":"https://accession.nodc.noaa.gov/0099812","linkName":"Descriptive Information","linkProtocol":"HTTPS"},{"linkFunction":"information","linkDescription":"Navigate directly to the URL for a descriptive web page with download links.","linkUrl":"https://accession.nodc.noaa.gov/oas/99812","linkName":"Descriptive Information","linkProtocol":"HTTPS"},{"linkFunction":"download","linkDescription":"Navigate directly to the URL for data access and direct download.","linkUrl":"https://accession.nodc.noaa.gov/download/99812","linkName":"HTTPS","linkProtocol":"HTTPS"},{"linkFunction":"download","linkDescription":"These data are available through the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
